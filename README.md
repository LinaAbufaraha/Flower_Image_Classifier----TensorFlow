# üå∏ Project: Image Classifier using TensorFlow

This repository contains an image classification model built using TensorFlow and Transfer Learning. It is trained on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset and enables users to classify flower images via a command-line application.

## üåü Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Train an image classifier using a pre-trained model (MobileNet, InceptionV3, etc.).
- Fine-tune the classifier for the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.
- Save the trained model in `.h5` format.
- Use a command-line script (`predict.py`) to:
  - Predict the top K most likely classes.
  - Display class names using a JSON label map.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Libraries Used
- `TensorFlow`
- `TensorFlow Hub`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Pandas`
- `json`

  ### Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalization and resizing.
   - Splitting into training/validation/test.

2. **Transfer Learning**
   - Use a pre-trained model from `tensorflow_hub`.
   - Freeze base layers and add custom dense layers.

3. **Training**
   - Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy.
   - Optimizer: Adam.
   - Regularization: Dropout / L2 to prevent overfitting.

4. **Saving**
   - Export the trained model to `.h5`.

5. **Inference**
   - Use `predict.py` to classify new images.
   - Show top-K predictions with class names using a JSON label map.
